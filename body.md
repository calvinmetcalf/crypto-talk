*projections* in web browsers are *terrible*

and you should be *ashamed* of yourself

my name is *calvin*

i have *opinions*

*why*

one of the main devs of *proj4js*

work with *leaflet*

everything is terrible

*what is a projection*

when people say projections, they mean a

*spatial reference system*

which includes

a *spheroid* or model of the earths shape

a *datum* which are reference points to measure from on the sphere

a *coordinate* system with units and and starting points

if it's projected

a *transform* to flatten it

*background*

whats the best projection to use?

the one that works for where you are

in other words

everyone has their own projection

*124* in the state plane system

with a version for feet and meters

and versions in the *data* (plural of *datum*) *NAD27*, *NAD83*

plus in addition to original *NAD83* we have *HARN* and *NSRS2007* variants

= *992* systems

this is just *'murica*

*so many*

math is hard

if you don't have a computer

esp trig, and logs

so traditionally reprojection is *hard*

so an agency picks a projection and does EVERYTHING in that one

e.g. (when I was at *MassDOT* we used *Massachusetts Mainland Meters NAD83*)

this is great

if printers are the main way that data is transfered

desktop GIS software is built around this idea

there are assumptions that projections rarely change

and are never to be mixed because

*TRIG!!!!1*

fast forward to now

when was the last time *CPU* was the limiting factor for you?

right its the mobile web where compared to enterprise GIS:

cellphones are *literally* supercomputers

at times my phone is faster then my (work) desktop

most web apps are *IO* bound not *CPU* bound

there is fairly limited space

but data transfer is severely limited

this means

*EPSG* numbers are right out
